In Wordle, users have 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word. You're helped along the way by ruling out letters that aren't in the word, and being told whether the correct letters are in the correct location or not.

## Winning and Loosing:

The user wins the game when their guessed word is identical to the `answer`. They lose the game if they submit 6 guesses without winning.
